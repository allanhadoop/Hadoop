Hadoop cluster is master and slave nodes. Combination of one set of master+slaves is called rack. Rack has switch ,if that fails then whole 
rack will be down. 

Client - This is requester who wants to communicate to HDFS filesystem which is categorized into name and data node
Master node is name node (it manages names of directories and files) 
Slave node is data node (it manages data of file)

# # see attached pdf file for more detail 

# HDFS interfaces to perform file operation on hdfs
1. command line
2. Apache Hue
3. Java API
4. Rest API webhdfs
5. C Api libhdfs


Hadoop single node cluster includes - name node, datanode and hadoop client .while working on large multi-node cluster , access to 
name node or data node may be restricted due to security reasons , so there are few edge nodes which can be used for hdfs operations
edge nodes are like data nodes which can be used for day to day operations.
